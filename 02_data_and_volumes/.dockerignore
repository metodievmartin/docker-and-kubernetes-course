# .dockerignore file
# ------------------------------
# This file specifies which files and directories should be excluded when copying files
# to the Docker image using the COPY command in the Dockerfile.
# Similar to .gitignore, it helps keep your Docker image clean and minimal.

# Exclude the Dockerfile itself
# We don't need the Dockerfile inside our image as it's only used for building
Dockerfile

# Exclude node_modules directory
# Since we run 'npm install' inside the container, we don't need to copy
# the local node_modules folder, which might contain platform-specific dependencies
node_modules

# Exclude macOS system files
# These are macOS-specific files that have no use in the container
.DS_Store

# Exclude IDE configuration files
# IDE-specific files and directories are not needed in the container
.idea

# Exclude Git directory
# The Git repository metadata is not needed in the container
# This significantly reduces the image size if you have a large Git history
.git
